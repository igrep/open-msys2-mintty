# open-msys2-mintty

A tiny script to launch bash on mintty at the given directory.

# Motivation

I want to launch bash on mintty from an explorer window just **by a single click**!
When I googled frist, I found a [nice registry entry](https://gist.github.com/magthe/a60293fe395af7245a9e).
But it just adds to the **shortcut menu**, which needs **two clicks** to launch actually!

So, I decided to make a tiny script to use with [StExBar](http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/StExBar.html)
or any other tools like that.
